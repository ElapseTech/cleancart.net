CleanCart in .NET
=================

***This is a work in progress***

This project aims to serve as a demonstration of a clean and evolutive architecture.

Everything is done with ATDD and TDD. 

We will commit as we go, and often backtrack. This is a normal development cycle: we make mistakes and we fix them. 

Open to discussion
==================

Software development is never an exact science.
